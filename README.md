# Introduction
This project aims at migrating the previous tech stack that used MySQL database for warehouse and Redash for reporting to Postgres database and Superset automatically.

Data management in any given company is crucial because it ensures the availability of data for analytics. This has been aided by the use of databases. Examples of database services are MySQL and PostgreSQL systems. Previously, I used MySQL database management system as my data warehouse and this weekâ€™s project focused on migrating my data warehouse to the PostgreSQL system. PostgreSQL is one of the oldest yet the most advanced open source database management system.

Under the scripts folder, there is a python script migrate_database.py used to automate the migration
